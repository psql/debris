## What was debris?

Debris was a little toy built by [Pasquale](http://twitter.com/pasql) & [Kyle](http://twitter.com/kylebragger) sometime in 2011. It got put to rest, but then [resurrected in 2012](http://psql.me/debris), when Pasquale joined Elepath. 

It was kinda like a multimedia chat room. The whole point was to "just have fun". There was a good amount of nudity. People met and started dating on there. Some users clocked over 24 hours in a session. 

Media was destroyed after 24 hours.

There was a camera app for iOS, which just posted imgs to debris, and let you view and chat.

You could go to an obscure URL if you wanted your own private room. E.g. debris.cc/dogsOnLogs

Moderators would try their best to kick trolls into 'hell'. Hell was just a room full of the worst users. It was the only room they could access.


Someone want to help build this thing?
